# Invasive Species: Migration Paths using R
Hello! this is an R script that traces and predicts where species will move when their habitat changes, according to environmental factors, which are related to the occurrence of this species.
Using data freely available on the Internet, we find the GPS positions of the avistaminetos of the species, meteorological data of those areas, and the environmental factors of those regions, then we look for other regions that have similar conditions, so that we can build a prediction model that shows the places that have a greater chance of containing those species.
